# Visual Odometry Repository

This repository is dedicated to implementing and experimenting with various types of visual odometry techniques. The initial focus was on monocular visual odometry, which has now reached a stable point. Moving forward, development will shift towards implementing and improving stereo visual odometry methods.

## Status

- Monocular visual odometry: Feature-complete and stable.
- Stereo visual odometry: Development in progress.

## Monocular VO Demo

Below is a demonstration of the monocular visual odometry system in action:

Stay tuned for updates as stereo visual odometry features are added and improved.
